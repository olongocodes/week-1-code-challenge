1. Grade. js file 
In the student grade Generator:
-Any grade within the range of 0-100 is returned as according to the grade marks entered. For example let grade = 50; will display grade C.
-Otherwise the grade is returned as an invalid grade. For example a value below 0 eg -1 or a value above 100 eg 101 will be returned as an invalid grade.  



2. Speed Detector (Toy Problem)

It is program that takes the speed of a car as input e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it prints “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

   > For example, if the speed is 80, it print: “Points: 2”. 
   >If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function print: “License suspended”.
